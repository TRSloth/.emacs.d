# Emacs
 My first Emacs setup, had to rebase to remove my inclusion of emacs within it, bad enough including the library's but you live and learn and I'm a hell of a lot better at emacs and git as a result.
Addmittedly I've probably left a lot in here I should remove but I can do that from a tag on my current.
 
 Decided to add it as an archive to current branch to show progress :)
