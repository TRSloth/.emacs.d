# My Emacs Config

My Emacs Config allows you to view my notes as I see then.

My notes should be fairly self-evident though I use a range of Emacs tools and packages to give them structure and help form ideas in my brain.  This config will allow you to see my notes as I see them(with any luck).


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* Windows 10 (64bit) or Kali(Linux), should work on other OS's but those are the ones I've tested.

## Installing My Emacs Config

To install My Emacs Config, follow these steps:
### Windows:
1. Create a symlink from where emacs expects to find this file to where you've placed it, or move to the correct location.
```
mklink /J C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d C:\path\to\this\repo
```
2. Press `<Win>+R`
2. Type `"C:\Program Files\Emacs\bin\runemacs.exe"` + RET 
4. Use-package will start installing things: Go make a cup of tea/coffee
5. Delete org-brain.elc (in .emacs.d/elpa/org-brain-xxxx/), this fixes a [known issue](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain/issues/320)
6. Done :)

### Linux:
1. Create a symlink from where emacs expects to find this file to where you've placed it, or move to the correct location.
```
ls -s /path/to/this/repo/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
```
2. Enter `<Win>` + `"Emacs"` + RET
3. Use-package will start installing things
4. When asked about installing packages answer yes(these were included for windows as they can't auto-install)
5. Delete org-brain.elc (in .emacs.d/elpa/org-brain-xxxx/), this fixes a [known issue](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain/issues/320)
6. Done :)
