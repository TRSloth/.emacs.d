# My Emacs Config

Emacs Config preconfigured for org-roam(including server), org-brain, pdftools and a range of bibleography and note-taking tools.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* Windows 10 (64bit) or Kali(Linux), should work on other OS's but those are the ones I've tested.

## Installing My Emacs Config

[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [download](https://github.com/TRSloth/emacs-old/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository

Then to install the repository, follow these steps:
### Windows:
1. Create a symlink from where emacs [expects to find](https://superuser.com/questions/137971/where-is-the-emacs-file-located-on-windows) the .emacs.d file to where you've placed it, or move it to the correct location.
```
mklink /J C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d C:\path\to\this\repo
```
2. Press `<Win>+R`
2. Type `"C:\Program Files\Emacs\bin\runemacs.exe"` + RET 
4. Use-package will start installing things: Go make a cup of tea/coffee
5. Delete `org-brain.elc` (in `.emacs.d/elpa/org-brain-xxxx/`), this fixes a [known issue](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain/issues/320)
6. Right-click and select edit on `.emacs.d/win/org-protocols.reg` and check the path is correct then double-click the program to run. 
7. Done :)

### Linux:
1. Create a symlink from where emacs [expects to find](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsDotD) this file to where you've placed it, or move itto the correct location.
```
ls -s /path/to/this/repo/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
```
2. Enter `<Win>` + `"Emacs"` + RET
3. Use-package will start installing things
4. When asked about installing packages answer `yes`(these were included for windows as they can't auto-install)
5. Delete `org-brain.elc` (in `.emacs.d/elpa/org-brain-xxxx/`), this fixes a [known issue](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain/issues/320)
6. Done :)
