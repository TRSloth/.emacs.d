# My Emacs Prelude Config

My Emacs Prelude Config allows you to view my notes as I see then.

My notes should be fairly self-evident though I use a range of Emacs tools and packages to give them structure and help form ideas in my brain.  This config will allow you to see my notes as I see them(with any luck).


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* You have installed [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/), the easiest way to do this is to clone the repository and place the contents in the .emacs.d file (This is located at c:/Users/<YourName>.AppData/Roaming), I typically replace this folder with a [symlink](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/) the config I with to use allowing for use of multiple configurations.
* Prelude also has a numer of optional [prerequisites](https://prelude.emacsredux.com/en/latest/installation/) which for just viewing my note's I wouldn't worry about, though if I do convert you to emacs their work considering.
* You have a Windows 10 (64bit) machine. I've also done built some of the configuration for Linux though this is incomplete, so I can't guarentee it will work.
