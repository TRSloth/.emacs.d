# My Emacs Config

My Emacs Config allows you to view my notes as I see then.

My notes should be fairly self-evident though I use a range of Emacs tools and packages to give them structure and help form ideas in my brain.  This config will allow you to see my notes as I see them(with any luck).


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* You have a Windows 10 (64bit) machine. I've also done built some of the configuration for Linux though this is incomplete, so I can't guarentee it will work.

## Installing My Emacs Config

To install My Emacs Config, follow these steps:

Windows:
```
mklink /J C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d C:\path\to\this\repo
```
## Using My Emacs Config

To use My Emacs Config, follow these steps:
1. Press <Win>+R
2. Type "C:\Program Files\Emacs\bin\runemacs.exe"
3. Press enter.
4. Done, all packages should be installed by use-package :)
```

## Why have you done the same thing twice

Good question, story short I needed to rebuild my config with use-package to allow for auto-installation on multiple machiences and I heard prelude was useful for this as everything was in one directory.  However, after getting most of it up and running it felt sluggish and I was having some issues with keybinds. So I decided to transition back to stock emacs using .gitignore to not version control the programs that will install themself's.
